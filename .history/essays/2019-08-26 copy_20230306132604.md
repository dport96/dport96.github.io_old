# Bad Practices for Novices to Avoid

Here is a compendium of bad practices I've observed are common begginnging programmers. If you recognize yourself doing any of these, try to the advice given in Better Practice. There more a bad practice becomes a habit, the more difficult it will be to change to a practice that is more effective! 

**Bad Practice:** Blindly copying code into your code from another source (such as Stack Overflow, chartGBT, or a classmate). 

**Why this is bad:** The context for your situation will likely be different so the code you copy is unlikely to be exactly what you need. This may be simple things such as the variables are not named the same as your variables or can me more complicated such as the code doesn't address exactly what you want (because the source of your code doesn't know exactly what you want within the context of your situation). Also, the code you copy may have problems or does things in a way that doesn't suit your situation (such as the use of more advanced techniques you don't understand or are "overkill"), or use components/libraries/functions you don't have access to or are unnecessary. You will likely try to add too much code at once and will have trouble integrating it into your code. You will not be sure where to put it in your code. This will likely mess up your structure, increase the complexity, and make it much harder to find and fix problems.  Even if you do get code that "works" you will find it harder to extend this code to complete your program or do other things later (we often build on previous work).

**Better Practice:** If you're stuck on what code to write start by "going backward" to ensure that you clearly understand what you want to do and how it will do it. If you find you are confused about how to do something, go backward again and simplify the situation until it's very clear what you want to do. Then move forward by thinking about how you can do what's wanted. When this is clear, then you think about what code you need to write to accomplish this by breaking it down into simple steps (this is the algorithmic thinking part!) and translating this into code. Usually, this will be pretty straightforward. If you find you don't know how to write the code you want, then do some research. Look for examples of code that are similar to what you want to do. When you find such examples, do not blindly copy them into your code! Study the example and if you understand it well, think about if it can be easily adapted to what you want. If it can, copy a small part of the code into your code and start adapting it being sure to test it carefully before you copy more code. If you find that adapting it may be too much trouble, then use the code to "inspire" you on how to do what you want and start writing your own code rather than copying the example. You will find that this will often take less time and you will have less trouble with the code you write!

**Bad Practice:** Trying random code you don't understand hoping you will "see" what to do from it.

**Why this is bad:** Every line of code will have a specific purpose for being there. The purpose is dictated by the design choices you make on how to accomplish what is wanted. Random code does not "flow" from the design so it will unlikely by chance do what you want.

**Better Practice:** Do not ever write (or copy) code that you do not clearly know flows from your design. You should know exactly what each line of code does (or is supposed to do) and why it's there. If you do not, DELETE this code! If you are unclear on the design, "go backward" to clarify that you know exactly what is wanted (or at least what you want).

**Bad Practice:** Continuing to write (or copy) code when you are stuck or having problems hoping that things will "fall into place" or the problem will go away with more code.

**Why this is bad:** The more code you write, the more problems you add and the harder it will be to find and fix. Eventually, your code becomes so muddled that you cannot work with it anymore.

**Better Practice:** Slow down! Always leave your code in a "working" state. Frequently test your code. A good rule of thumb is to write no more than 7 lines of code before you test (of course this may vary depending on what you are writing as some situations will require more code to be in a place you can conduct a test). If you get stuck, try simplifying what you are doing. This may mean taking a smaller step toward implementing something. When you get that working, then take another small step. If you are still stuck and unable to progress, revert your code to the last place that was working (you may need to comment out code you have been trying). When things are working again, try working on something different and come back to your problem area later. The additional structure you add may help you see a way to address your problem or taking a break and coming to it fresher may offer a solution. If find yourself having many problems and are totally lost, consider starting over! Delete (or archive) what you have been working on and start again. You are unlikely to run into the same problems again and you will find that it takes less effort and get better results to start anew rather than try to find, fix, and patch together your previous code.
