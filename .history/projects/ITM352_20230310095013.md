I'm continually evolving the ITM 352 undergraduate MIS course in programming. The current approach to this course is:

- Hands-on active learning lab exercises and "workouts of the day"
- Applications with progressive development of a complex real-world web application (e-store)
- Develop programming skill and software development skill (introductory software engineering)
- Use of contemporary tools (GitHub, VSCode, Node.js) and web resources
- Technical problem-solving, self-reliance, and rapid self-learning
- Alignment with software development cognitive skill-levels
