I'm continually evolving the BUS 619 graduate course in Business Statistics and Data Analytics. The approach to this course:

- Hands-on active learning through real-world case exercises
- Applications with a forecasting project using real-data for a publicly traded company
- Develop analytical and communication skills
- Use of common tools (Excel) and web resources
